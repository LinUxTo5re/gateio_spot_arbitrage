In asynchronous programming, using the `await` keyword does not necessarily mean waiting for the current
 function's execution in a blocking manner. When an `await` is encountered in an async function, 
it allows the event loop to switch to other tasks or coroutines that are ready to execute
 without halting the entire program's flow. This is the essence of non-blocking behavior in async programming.

Here's a breakdown of how `await` operates in asynchronous code:

1. **Async Function Execution**: When an async function is invoked, it returns a coroutine object,
 indicating that it can be suspended and resumed.

2. **Await Expression**: When encountering an `await` expression within an async function, 
it doesn't necessarily mean that the current function execution halts completely. Instead, 
it allows the event loop to continue executing other tasks or coroutines that are ready to run.

3. **Waiting for Asynchronous Operation**: The `await` expression does pause the execution of the current 
coroutine until the awaited asynchronous operation completes. During this time, 
the event loop can schedule and execute other coroutines or tasks that are not dependent on the awaited operation.

4. **Non-Blocking Nature**: Asynchronous programming enables concurrency by allowing multiple asynchronous
 operations to run concurrently within a single thread. While one coroutine awaits 
an I/O operation (such as network request, file read, etc.), the event loop can switch to 
executing other coroutines that are ready to continue.

5. **Continuation After Await**: Once the awaited operation is completed, 
the event loop resumes the suspended coroutine at the point where the `await` expression was encountered, 
allowing the coroutine to continue its execution.

In summary, using `await` in async programming doesn't block the entire program's execution. 
It enables non-blocking behavior by allowing the event loop to manage the execution of multiple tasks 
concurrently, pausing and resuming coroutines as needed based on the completion of awaited asynchronous operations. 
This concurrency allows for more efficient use of time, especially in scenarios involving I/O-bound
 operations where waiting for external resources is common.
